# Combine-PDF

Requires Ghostscript: https://ghostscript.com/releases/gsdnld.html

Put this Powershell file in a folder containing PDFs and run it to combine them all into one PDF.

Note: this will delete the individual PDFs and leave you with just the one Combined.pdf so please test on copies first.
